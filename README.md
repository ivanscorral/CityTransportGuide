City Transport Guide is an iOS application that helps users explore the public transportation options in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The app displays a map with markers for different public transport resources like buses, trains, and scooters, and provides additional information about each resource when a user taps on a marker.

## Features

- Fetches **real-time data from the API** for the resources
- Provides **detailed information about each resource**, including:
  - *Name*
  - *Coordinates*
  - *Type of transport*
  - *Available resources*
  - *Other relevant parameters*
- Allows users to **open the resource location in Google Maps**
- **Handles API error responses** and **displays alerts to the user**
- Uses the **MVVM architectural pattern**
